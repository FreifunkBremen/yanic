# About

A little overview of yanic in connection with other software:

## How respondd works

It sends the `gluon-neighbour-info` request and collects the answers.

It will send UDP packets with multicast address `ff05:0:0:0:0:0:2:1001` and port `1001`.

If a node does not answer, it will request with the last know address under the port `1001`.
