# Configuration

Here you would find a long description, maybe the description in [example file](https://github.com/FreifunkBremen/yanic/blob/main/config_example.toml) are enough for you.

The config file for Yanic written in "Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language." [syntax](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml).
(if you need somethink multiple times, checkout out the [[array of table]] section)

## [respondd]
{% method %}
Group for configuration of respondd request.
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
[respondd]
enable           = true
# synchronize    = "1m"
collect_interval = "1m"

#[respondd.sites.example]
#domains            = ["city"]

#[[respondd.custom_field]]
#name = zip
# You can use arbitrary GJSON expressions here, see https://github.com/tidwall/gjson
# We expect this expression to return a string.
#path = nodeinfo.location.zip

[[respondd.interfaces]]
ifname             = "br-ffhb"
#ip_address        = "fe80::..."
#send_no_request   = false
#multicast_address = "ff02::2:1001"
#port              = 10001
```
{% endmethod %}


### enable
{% method %}
Enable request and collection of data per respondd requests
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
enable = true
```
{% endmethod %}


### synchronize
{% method %}
Delay startup until a multiple of the period since zero time
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
synchronize      = "1m"
```
{% endmethod %}


### collect_interval
{% method %}
How often send request per respondd.

It will send UDP packets with multicast address `ff05::2:1001` and port `1001`.
If a node does not answer after the half time, it will request with the last know address under the port `1001`.
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
collect_interval = "1m"
```
{% endmethod %}


### [respondd.sites.example]
{% method %}
Tables of sites to save stats for (not exists for global only).
Here is the site _ffhb_.
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
[respondd.sites.ffhb]
domains            = ["city"]
```
{% endmethod %}

#### domains
{% method %}
list of domains on this site to save stats for (empty for global only)
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
domains            = ["city"]
```
{% endmethod %}


### [[respondd.interfaces]]
{% method %}
Interface that has an ip address in your mesh network.
It is possible to have multiple interfaces, just add this group again with new parameters (see toml [[array of table]]).
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
[[respondd.interfaces]]
ifname             = "br-ffhb"
#ip_address        = "fe80::..."
#send_no_request   = false
#multicast_address = "ff02::2:1001"
#port              = 10001
```
{% endmethod %}

### ifname
{% method %}
name of interface on which this collector is running.
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
ifname              = "br-ffhb"
```
{% endmethod %}

### ip_address
{% method %}
ip address is the own address which is used for sending.
If not set or set with empty string it will take an address of ifname.
(It prefers the link local address, so at babel mesh-network it should be configurated)
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
ip_address          = "fe80::..."
```
{% endmethod %}

### send_no_request
{% method %}
Disable sending multicast respondd request.
For receiving only respondd packages e.g. database respondd.
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
send_no_request     = true
```
{% endmethod %}

### multicast_address
{% method %}
Multicast address to destination of respondd.
If not set or set with empty string it will take the batman default multicast address `ff05::2:1001`
(Needed to set for legacy `ff02::2:1001`)
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
multicast_address    = "ff02::2:1001"
```
{% endmethod %}

### port
{% method %}
Define a port to listen and send the respondd packages.
If not set or set to 0 the kernel will use a random free port at its own.
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
port              = 10001
```
{% endmethod %}

### [[respondd.custom_fields]]
{% method %}
If you have custom respondd fields, you can ask Yanic to also collect these.

NOTE: This does not automatically include these fields in the output.
The meshviewer-ffrgb output module will include them under "custom_fields",
but other modules may simply ignore them.

{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
name = zip
# You can use arbitrary GJSON expressions here, see https://github.com/tidwall/gjson
# We expect this expression to return a string.
path = nodeinfo.location.zip
```
{% endmethod %}

The geojson output produces a geojson file which contains the location data of all monitored nodes to be used to visualize the location of the nodes.
It is optimized to be used with [UMap](https://github.com/umap-project/umap) but should work with other tools as well.

Here is a public demo provided by Freifunk Muenchen: http://u.osmfr.org/m/328494/

For usage in Prometheus read there Documentation [Use file-based service discovery to discover scrape targets](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/file-sd/).
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
[[nodes.output.prometheus-sd]]

Use the `node_id` as value, to put the Node ID into the target list as address.
Use the `ip` as value to put the last IP address into the target list from where the respondd message is recieved (maybe a link-local address).
Default value is `ip`.

{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
path     = "/var/www/html/meshviewer/data/prometheus-sd.json"
```
{% endmethod %}


### [nodes.output.prometheus-sd.labels]

## [[nodes.output.raw-jsonl]]
{% method %}
This output takes the respondd response as sent by the node and inserts it into a line-separated JSON document (JSONL). In this format, each line can be interpreted as a separate JSON element, which is useful for json streaming. The first line is a json object containing the timestamp and version of the file. This is followed by a line for each node, each containing a json object.
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
[[nodes.output.raw-jsonl]]
enable   = false
path     = "/var/www/html/meshviewer/data/raw.jsonl"

{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
delete_after = "7d"
delete_interval = "1h"
```
{% endmethod %}

Every database type has his own configuration under `database.connection`.
It is possible to have multiple connections for one type of database, just add this group again with new parameters (see toml [[array of table]]).
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
[[database.connection.example]]
enable = true
```
{% endmethod %}


### enable
{% method %}
Each database-connection has its own config block and needs to be enabled by adding:
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
enable = true
```
{% endmethod %}



## [[database.connection.influxdb]]

{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
enable   = false
address  = "http://localhost:8086"
database = "ffhb"
username = ""
password = ""
insecure_skip_verify = false
[database.connection.influxdb.tags]
tagname1 = "tagvalue 1"
system   = "productive"
site     = "ffhb"
```
{% endmethod %}


### address

Address to connect on InfluxDB server.
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
address  = "http://localhost:8086"
```

insecure_skip_verify = true
```
{% endmethod %}


### [database.connection.influxdb.tags]
{% method %}
You could set manuelle tags with inserting into a influxdb.
Useful if you want to identify the yanic instance when you use multiple own on the same influxdb (e.g. multisites).

Warning:
Tags used by Yanic would override the tags from this config (e.g. `nodeid`, `hostname`, `owner`, `model`, `firmware_base`, `firmware_release`, `frequency11g`, `frequency11a`).
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
tagname1 = "tagvalue 1s"

{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
address = "localhost:2003"
```
{% endmethod %}


### prefix
{% method %}
Graphite is replacing every "." in the metric name with a slash "/" and uses
that for the file system hierarchy it generates. it is recommended to at least
move the metrics out of the root namespace (that would be the empty prefix).
If you only intend to run one community and only freifunk on your graphite node
then the prefix can be set to anything (including the empty string) since you
probably wont care much about "polluting" the namespace.
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
prefix = "freifunk"
```
{% endmethod %}

path     = "/var/log/yanic.log"
```
{% endmethod %}


### path
